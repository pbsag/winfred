# winfred


This is the travel demand model for the Winchester-Fredericksburg, Virginia region. The model is
developed largely in Cube 6.1, with some submodules executed in R. The model
includes an installation of R, and no additional software (beyond Cube) is
necessary to run the model.



The model user's guide is available on the [winfred wiki](https://github.com/pbsag/winfred/wiki)
